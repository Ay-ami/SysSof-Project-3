To run the program, leave all c and header files within the folder along with the .txt file.
To choose what gets printed on Eustis, you must type in a combination of -l, -a, -v in the compile command. 
No matter what though, the program will always create an output.txt to show the results of the entire compiler in action. 
Included is a good test case and a bad test case with an error. To use this one change "input.txt" to "input2.txt" in lex.h
